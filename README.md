 Modeling of biophysically plausible neural networks in various scales has provided in sights in studies ranging from basic function of neural circuitry to mechanism of memory and sleep. This approach has been shown more promising than ever as more realistic models can be implemented thanks to the rapid advance of computer technologies. Nevertheless, model complexity and size still pose significant challenges to simulation speed and reproducibility. The simulation can be accelerated either by introducing concepts of software design, or by reduce the complexity of the model. Here, we demonstrate the computational utility is optimized by employing both strategies. We transport models of different neural levels from MatLab to NEST, and compare the results of simulation and the performance of the two software. On the other hand, we reduce the complexity of single neuron model and discuss the limitation of the simplified model. Finally, the computational speed is compared. This study shows NEST enables evaluation of the relations between psychophysical data and biophysical data by realizing implementation of complicated, large-scaled biophysically plausible neural fields .
